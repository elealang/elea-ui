how will CSS loading work?

Document should be parameterized by CSS Set
CSS Sets should be dependent on available CSS files from FS


eventually use TH to generate types for available CSS files
CSS files could also be typed/linked to elea objects
will come back to this later
need to think about how we can automate CSS using Elea structure
so for now just go with simple solution
